I think I did a pretty good job, all things considered.
Used mongoDB with Passport Session instead of JWt (There was nothing specified for bootlegging, so i figured it was fine.)
I think session works better fo rthis usecase since it is a blog for non-dev users. 

run 'npm install' to get all dependencies
for a better experience, plase run this in your browser as the client. 
You can a VS code client (POstman or TC), but it just ain't as fun

P.S. I hate tests.
